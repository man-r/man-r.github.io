              <h4>1. Announcement in the Media </h4>
                <p>
                    On 2 Jan 2016 it was announced in the media that the sentence has already been done which came as a surprise to everyone specially the supporters of Shaikh Nimr who were hoping that king Salman will not endorse the ruling given by Specialized Criminal Court on 15 Oct 2014.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even though the list contains 47 citizens the media did not try to hide the fact that Shaikh AlNimr was one of them. on the contrary, the media made sure that Shaikh AlNimr name is shown in the headline of the announcement along with Faris Shwil who was a member of al-Qaeda.

              <h4>2. timing </h4>
                <p>
                    The timing of the execution is still not clear, wither it was on Saturday 2 Jan 2016 or Friday 1 Jan 2016.

                <p>
                    Even though there were no attempt in hiding the name Shaikh AlNimr among the other 46 who were in the announcement but the timing of the execution came shortly after several important announcement like the kingdom 2015 budget and the rise of the gasoline, electricity and water prices which is still a hot topic among the public at the time. not only that but (as stated earlier) the announcement came Saturday which is the last day of the weekend before everyone gets busy with there jobs which starts early Sunday.
