                    as i said from PART 3, It was obvious to me that I won't be able to enjoy it alone. Two hours after reserving the tour I whent back to the lobby to meet my tour guide. I saw a beautiful girl standing in the lobby next to a man waring the tourist guide shirts both of them I said to myself. "Please let the pretty girl be my guide" And it wasðŸ˜³. Wen she saw me she said "Hi my name is eldrees and I'll be your tour guide" She also said that she will also be my guide for the other tour and it's fine by her if I want to change her later I said let's see today what happens and we will decide later.

                <h3>First Trip</h3>
                <p>
                    My first trip was a tour by car around the city then we will go to visit some famous hotel where celebrity stay. The places were nice there were a lot of celebrity pictures in the hotel. It was more of a museum rather than hotel. Even though it is still functioning hotel but I consider it museum.

                <p>
                    Eldrees was very nice She knows what she is doing Her English was excellent so it didn't take me long to decide not to change her I am not going to deny that being a female helps

                <h3>Girlfreind Exeriance</h3>
                <p>
                    In the hotel I saw a stage that looks like for performance shows. Like music plays so I asked eldrees.

                    Do they still use it for shows?
                    She said yes absolutely. There is one tonight. 
                    I said book me a ticket. 
                    She said but this is not part of the tour
                    I said fine I'll do it myself

                    So I booked a ticket and decided to come back at night. I asked for a taxi from the hotel and one of the hotel staff offer to go with me I went there and it was raining I entered the hotel and they put me all the way in the back because of the wheelchair. It was very far from the stage but you have a good overview of the entire place. You can order food while you are watching the show So I ordered the shrimp.

                    I looked around and the place was full of old Canadian. It was musical and dancing didn't understand anything of what was going on in the play itself I didn't even like it. It is not my thing honestly. However, The table just below me on the right was interesting. The people were interesting. It was 3 people 2 men one girl. One of the men looked very old man the other one was younger and waring a suit. The girl was very young for both of them Looks like her early 20s maybe younger.

                    The girl was good looking. Didn't manage to see her face clearly but she was ok. She was wearing short blue dress. I think she was Cuban, but the old man was definitely not Cuban. He was talking to girl none stop. The old man was talking and the girl was looking at him and nodding her head. It was obvious that she was pretending to be interested. The guy was loud so I can immediately noticed that he was talking in English. Then he said something to the girl like a question. then i saw the other man was translating to the girl that's when I noticed that she doesn't speak English. And she was actually providing the old man the "girlfriend experience " during his stay in Cuba. So simply she was just nodding her head even though she doesn't understand anything.
