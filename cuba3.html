                <h3>Things Must change</h3>
                <p>
                    the first morning in Havana. decided after breakfast i will find solution to my issues then start enjoying my vacation. so i went to the business center to surf the net and i started looking for good hotels nearby. i found one which was 7 blocks away from my hotel and they have a room that i can use. so i decided to go there walking this way i can see the city and go to the hotel at the same time.

                <p>
                    in my way to the hotel a Cuban guy stopped me and started talking to me in Spanish i guess he was asking me if i needed help. i was expecting to be confused for a Latino since when i was in Delphian school in there summer program the American first guess of my nationality was Mexican that’s when i know that Arabs and Latinos have very similar physical features. anyway, i explained to him that i don't speak Spanish and no i doesn’t need help, suddenly he got very excited and apologies to me for mistaking me for Cuban and started to talk to me about Cuba and history and cigars and salsa. i went along with him for a while until i got bored so i ditched him and went to the new hotel.

                <p>
                    got to the new hotel i like it booked it for the remaining of my vacation. and brought by bags from the old hotel and went out for another walk. Only five minutes after i left the hotel door two young couple stopped me. this time they did not try to guess where am i from but asked me about it and the usual reaction on their face "ooohh ARAB HU, PITROOOL" they asked did you went to the cigar factory? i said no. they offered to take me there i accepted after some hesitation.

                <p>
                    after five minutes of walking i realized that we are heading to a back ali so i asked "this is not the way to the cigar factory is it?" they said today is sunday the factory is closed and we are taking you to house who work there and will sell you cigars from the factory but with a cheaper price. i stopped i was prepared to get out from this situation but i thought to myself "i came to Cuba searching for an adventure but this sounds like a bad idea i could get in troble ... sounds like an adventure so f**k it i'm doing this". they took me to this hose there was a little girl in bejamas setting on a wooden chair watching cartoons on tv. we went to room in the back and it was full of cigar boxes. they tried selling me one but i refused and said that i need to go back to the hotel. i told them that i want to buy one of the cigar boxes but i forgot my money in the hotel and insisted that they come with me to the hotel. i did not want to get into an argument with complete strangers in a foreign country in a house that i should not be in in the first place. by asking them to come with me to my hotel first i will be in safe place and i will have someone to take me there. yes you read it right 'I DO NOT KNOW THE WHEY BACK'.

                <p>
                    on the way back they asked me "what do i do for leaving back home in Saudi?" i said i worked with computers "HACKER???" the guy screamed i said "sometimes yes" that’s when the girl said "how many girlfriend do you have" i replied "I DON'T HAVE ANY WHY DO YOU THIK I HAVE MORE THAT ONE" that’s when the guy said because hackers have many girlfriends. i have no idea where did he come up with this but when we reached the hotel street i told them that i'm not interested in buying cigars or any "girlfriends" from them. the girl started to say that they are poor and she has a hungry kid that she need to feed but have no money. i gave them 5 dollars and asked them leave me alone.

                <p>
                    as soon as i went back to the hotel i went to the tours office and book one tour every day for as long as i'm in Cuba. starting from today. in was obvious to me that doing it alone will not allow me to see the must be seen in Havana.

                    two hours after reserving the tours a beautiful lady showed up and told me that she was my guide. she also said that she will be my guide for the other tours but i don't like her and i want to change that will be fine with her. first i thought that this is just the way they work but later on i discovered that she thought of me as a "special case" from her past experience. and trust me whatever explanation for the phrase "special case" is in your mind it’s not it but i leave that for part4.
