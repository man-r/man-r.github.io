                <h3>SIM problems</h3>
                <p>
                    after reaching my room its time to call my mother and tell her that i arived safly as she kept remiding me to do so for the passed week. terned on my mobile phone" and the bad news keeps on coming" rather than reciving the usual sms saying welcome to ... this is the embessy number i got a messege saying your sim dose not work here. no problem i'll send a whatsapp message to my sister and she will tell hercalled the recieption and asked them for the internet connection and they said sorry we cannot help you right now you need to wait for tomorro and ask the people who work at the hotel business center "SORY MOM BUT U HAVE TO WAIT". so i took a quick shoer and went out looking for a restront to eat.

                <h3>Shirtless men and half naked girls</h3>
                <p>
                    left the hotel at around 11:00 pm looking for: restorant to eat, hotel neerbay i can stay in the last night i'm here, local SIM for my phone i can use. the roads were not let very well and the side rods were not let at all the only lights you get are from the ones coming from the buildings doars and window which was engh to see the shirt less men walking around and the  half naked girls. it is very tempting to go and check out what there offering but i was raised to know better. the shirtless men and the half naked girls in normal sercomstanses would scare me but not this time i had bigger problem to wory about. the streets in havana are very bad and not well maitaind so there where a lot of hols and cracks wich if i'm not carfull in this darkness i could hit or fall in one and that will surly throw me off of my wheelchair and becuase it was raining earlierit makes falling on the ground 10 times wors and thats what scaryed me but that did not stop me from rolling around for an hour. i found lots of resturants but all were full, found a hotel but i did not like, did not find a SIM.so i decided to go back to my hotel and eat at there restront and tomorrow i'll call my mother.
