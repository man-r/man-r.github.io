                <h3>Flirting</h3>
                <p>
                    flirting is one of these words that everyone understand it diffrently. and that it is why if prefer using the word "describing" instead of "flirting". however that only made him wonder why do people invented the word flirting? why the word describing was not enough? but he never give much thought about it.

                    one day while they were talking and laughing together and about eachother, the normal usual scilence happend where both of them suddenly stop talking and started think about somthing to say. she decided to break the scilence herself buy telling him "i want to be home :-(" and this switched the mood from laughing to kind of sad.

                <p>
                    he didn't know wat to say at the bigining so she said it again "i want to go hooooome". he looked straight into her grorges eyes and said to her with a gental smile in his face "describe your home. just say why will you be happier there". to his happines it worked her facial expresion changed. she liked the idea and the fact that she didn't expected his response made sound even better.

                    "Okaii" was her first respose. the way she said it was enogh for him to know that she liked the idea. after watching her preparing for her home discription by adjusting the way she was sitting and clearing her throught he relized that he needs to give her in the next few minuts his full attention. all of his sences are now geared towords what she is about to say. his ears filtered everything other than her soft vouice. his eyes established a tunle vision towords her kissable lips just incase his ears missed a words his eyes can lip read it.

                    she started feeling shy after noticing that he is fully foucused on her and seems to be enjoying himself doing to so she stop talking. he notice that she wants a response from him. he didnt have to invent anything he just said what on his mid. "you sound like a person writing a novel" he said. she laughed. "i loved it" he contiued "you should do this more".
                </p>
                <p>
                    that made her feel more shy. she couldn't look straight into his eyes and coverd her face with her hands. "U like it?" she asked. "No I LOVED IT" he replied. she started laughing again.

                    he said "it's good to say what you like" after saying that his interest in the word flirting started again suddenly. he started asking himself was she flirting now? can what she said considered to be flirting? but she was describing moment and events not only people!. then he told her "i'm sure just saying it made you little happy right?" his question was more of seeking for a confirmation to what he thinks he started to understand which is the meaning of the word flirt which was in his mind is THE FEELING OF HAPPYNESS AFTER DESCRIBING SOMETHING YOU LOVE.
                </p>

                <p>
                    she said yes but with some hesitation. her hesitation was the only thing that stoped him from confirming his understading. so untile he figurs it out he will still call the time that he talks about her beauty to her as discribing her.
